======
Ruroni
======

Ruroni is just a boilerplate for my python projects made to my particular taste, however, you are free to copy it and use it.

If you want to implement something within this scaffold, just follow the skeleton example.

Making Changes & Contributing
=============================

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any
changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd ruroni
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Don't forget to tell your contributors to also install and use pre-commit.
